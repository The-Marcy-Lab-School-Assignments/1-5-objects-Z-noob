# Question
What does it mean when we say something is "pass by reference" vs "pass by value." Which one is mutable?

# Answer
"Pass by Value" means that a copy of the actual value is passed to the function. Any changes made to this value in the function do not affect the original variable. On the other hand, "Pass by Reference" means that a reference to the original variable is passed to the function like a location name to space in memory. So, "Pass by Reference" is the one mutable.
