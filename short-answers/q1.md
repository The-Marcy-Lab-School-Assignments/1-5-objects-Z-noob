# Question
When would be a good time to use an array instead of an object, and vice versa? Please provide examples.

# Answer
When order matters use arrays but when readability matter use objects.

Examples: Find the age of the person in the care section of classX, it's faster to go through data/memory of objects with key names `classA:{sport:{...}}...classX:{care:{}}` than looking for a position `[[[[[]]]]]`, and the example I typed doesn't have actual vales/elements inside yet. So we can easily type `build.classX.care.person.age`, while in array format it might be `build[15][6][19][7]`, it would be a pain to understand what this represents later when we look back.
