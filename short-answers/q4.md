# Question
Watch this (10 minute video on JSON)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iiADhChRriM].

What is JSON? Why isn't the example below valid JSON?

```js
{
  name: "Zo",
  isCool: true,
  age: 28
}
```

# Answer
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, which is a data representation format. It's used in dozens of languages, API, and configs. Light weight (in terms of package/file size) and easy to read and write. To create a file with `.json`. It's power lies in it's deeply nesting or hierarchy ability.
The keys **have to be double quoted** `""` in JSON, that's why the example wasn't valid.
