# Question
What is a "shallow" clone, and why can it cause bugs?

# Answer
 "Shallow" clone creates a new object with references to the same memory locations as the original object, while "deep" clone creates a new object with new memory locations for all of its properties and nested objects or arrays. So, even though modification to shadow clone does not change the original memory, but the is affected by modification on original memory it's base on. It's like creating a git branch for the main the it is auto git pulling.

 Question from me: If I did:
```js
 let arr = [x, y, z]
 let copy = [...arr]
 copy.push(a, b , c)
 copy = arr
```
 Now if I modify either the arr or copy it's going to be in sync? Is this considered as infinite loop?
